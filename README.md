## Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js app & components
- `pages/api/` - API routes (chat, logging, health, transcript, audio)
- `src/` - Middleware, types, utilities (TTS, logger, cache, etc.)
- `tests/` - Test files for API, components, and utilities

## Documentation

- API and utility documentation is generated using TypeDoc and JSDoc comments.
- The generated HTML docs in `docs/` are not committed to git (see `.gitignore`).
- To generate documentation for the entire project locally, run:
  ```bash
  npx typedoc --out docs .
  ```
  Then open `docs/index.html` in your browser.

## Code Documentation & Best Practices

- All main API routes and utilities are documented with JSDoc comments for clarity and maintainability.
- JSDoc is used to describe function parameters, return values, and usage. See source files in `src/utils/` and `pages/api/` for examples.
- TypeScript types are used throughout for safety and editor support.
- Follow best practices for code comments and documentation. See [JSDoc guide](https://jsdoc.app/) for more info.
